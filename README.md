# User Management Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a fully functional web application designed to fetch and display user data from the JSONPlaceholder API. The application allows users to search and filter data in real-time, providing a smooth and responsive experience. The table dynamically updates based on user input and API responses, showcasing proficiency in DOM manipulation, API interaction, and JavaScript object handling.

## Features

- **Fetch Users**: A "Fetch Users" button triggers an API request to retrieve a list of users.
- **Dynamic Table**: The table is automatically generated and populated with user data, including Name, Username, Email, Phone, City, and Company.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages are displayed if the API request fails or if any issues occur during data fetching.
- **Optional Features** (Implemented):
  - **Sorting**: Table headers can be clicked to sort users by various fields.
  - **User Details**: Selecting a user displays additional detailed information.
  - **Pagination**: Manages the display of a large number of users efficiently.
